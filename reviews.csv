1,Alok Mishra,"It is a powerbank with good camera, storage and average phone features.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  My review after three months use:I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced."
2,Sanjeev Kumar,"Not recommend, if you want waste your  money  then purchase",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging."

4,Nitesh Bajpai,One of the best phones at affordable price...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage"
5,ishan gautam,Don't buy this product. Even the most basic things are faulty,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue."
6,Mangesh Dhere,Not worth,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone ðŸ˜¥"
7,Pratik Prasad Gupta,Average Phone at Over Price with some bugs,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average"
8,Kevin B.,Poor call quality and microphone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Call quality is poor. When loud speaker is on, Cannot hear properly on the other side, call is muffled or breaking. Do someone else face this similar issue ? Is there any way to fix. I could not raise a ticket to contact either Amazon or samsung. Camera quality is also average.  Hated it.Updated review after 20 daysStarted facing charging issuesStopped charging suddenly, don't know what to doNo more replacement from AmazonNice lesson learnt:1. Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4. Read the return and replacement policy thoroughly before buying."
9,Hemanth,Please avoid this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  1.On playing games, sound is too too less.2.Flash light too dull3. 7000Mah battery, all fake battery only last one day or one and a half day max4.
