5,Super!,5,- Really good sound quality- different from the boat variant which focuses more on bass- this one has done good crisp sound- battery back up is nice- charge time is slightly higher- the wires are little short as compared to boat headsets which can be an issue(I am comparing it with Boat as I have a boat headset too)Over all really satisfiedREAD MORE
