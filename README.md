Web scrapping is an automated method used to extract large amounts of data or gathering information from websites.
Web scrapping methods are:
1. Scrape HTML content from a page
2.Application Programming Interface(API's)
3.Parse HTML code with Beautiful soup

I have scrapped the data using HTML Parser method and the reviews are given in csv file format.
